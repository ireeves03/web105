    <h1>Bella's Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am taking this class mostly because it's a requirement for my Digital Media major. I also want to learn more about web development and possibly pursue a future career in it.</p>
    <h2>Bella's Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>

    <p>My favorite hobby of mine would be playing video games. I tend to enjoy multiplayer games more than single player, although I do enjoy some single player games. Most of the fun of gaming for me is playing with friends and messing around. Some of my favorite games at the moment are:<ul>
        <li>Genshin Impact</li>
        <li>Resident Evil</li>
        <li>Lethal Company</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Baking</h3>

    <p>I enjoy baking and cooking, but I mostly bake. I used to bake all the time with my step mother, we still bake things together occasionally when we have the time. A couple of the treats I've baked are:<ul>
        <li>Creme Brulee</li>
        <li>Kolaczki cookies</li>
        <li>Banana Bread</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Going out</h3>
    <p>I enjoy going out with friends and family. Whether it's grabbing something to eat, or simply finding a parking spot and jsut sitting in the car and talking. I just enjoy being out of the house sometimes and spending time with the people closest to me.</p>
