<h2>Character Roster</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
<p>Genshin Impact runs off of a "Gacha" system, essentially like gambling. There is an extensive character list, each charatcer has unique designs and stories a well as unqiue combat gameplay. In order for the player to obtain characters, they have to roll for them on certain rate-up banners. Although the game is free-to-play and players can get enough rewards to save up for certain characters, there are many micro-transactions for the in game currency that is quite tempting.</p>

<h3>Combat</h3>
<p> The combat system is free turn and relys on strategy and an understanding of the elemental reactions in-game. There are seven elements, anemo (wind), hydro (water), geo (earth), pyro (fire), electro (electricity), cryo (ice), and dendro (plant). Which all combine in different ways for different buffs and reactions, allowing for diverse gameplay and a numerous amount of strategies for clearing content. The game allows for multi-player in the open-world, mostly for combat in domains and boss fights. Friends can join your world and help fight enemies, you can coordinate teams with your co-op partners. When playing with my younger sibling, our favorite character's elements dont align well.</p>
<p>
    Me: <q>Wow, that's my favorite reaction!</q><br>
    My sibling had brought a <em>dendro</em> character to support my <em>cryo</em> character.
</p>
<p><strong>There is no reaction between ice and plant.</strong><br>
    Sibling: <q>...Shut up</q></p>
